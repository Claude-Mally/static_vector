# static_vector
Toy project actually generated by ChatGPT

This is what I asked ChatGPT

* Create a c++17 template similar to std::vector<T> with a maximum capacity specified in a template argument
* add more features and error handling to match the full functionality and robustness of std::vector
* Add iterators to make it work with for range loops
* regenerate with all code
* rename to static_vector and add move constructor and move assignment that works with smaller or equal capacity and size, or throw.
* Regenerate with snake_case template name, like in the standard library
